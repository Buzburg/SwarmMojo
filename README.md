# SwarmMojo

**An agent harness for decisions, knowledge and reusable workflows.**

SwarmMojo combines a Decision Maker, retrieval, open knowledge files, MCP tools and skills to prepare work for review. It brings the goal, relevant sources and selected instructions into a bounded request, then returns an advisory decision and a proposed next step. Your model and execution permissions remain separate.

The portable Python path is used on Windows and Linux. Omarchy is an optional integration; it is not required to use SwarmMojo. macOS has not been verified.

## Five parts

| Part | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **Decision Maker** | Rank supplied options, return structured results and abstain when configured thresholds are not met. The current backend uses heuristics; its scores are not calibrated probabilities of correctness. |
| **RAG** | Find relevant document passages through keyword and vector search, with source references and bounded context. |
| **OKF** | Import local knowledge files, preserve document metadata and update their search indexes. |
| **MCP** | Let a compatible agent call registered tools and read resources through one local server. |
| **Skills** | Supply reusable Markdown playbooks. Generated drafts need review before activation. |

The workflow is **request → knowledge and skills → decision → proposed next step → operator approval → separately configured execution**. The preparation API implements the first four steps. It does not execute the proposal or approve itself. See the [component map](docs/components.md).

## Try one useful thing first

From a downloaded or cloned checkout, with **Python 3.11 or later**:

```sh
python -I -S -B scripts/demo_first_run.py
```

No installation, account, model, GPU or network connection is needed. The demo creates a temporary invoice program, introduces a known bad edit and runs a real failing check. SwarmMojo extracts the error from the log, locates the function and restores the original file. The check must pass again before the temporary files are removed and success is reported.

Add `--json` to inspect the original failure log, compacted log, source location and before/after file hashes. The demo accepts no path to your project. It demonstrates controlled recovery, not autonomous repair or safe rollback of concurrent edits. [Verification scope](docs/first-run-demo.md).

## Prepare a task for review

The harness command uses the lightweight dependencies in `requirements-ci.txt`. From the repository root, create a virtual environment and install them:

```sh
python -m venv .venv
```

Use `.venv/bin/python` on Linux or `.venv/Scripts/python.exe` on Windows for the following commands:

```sh
python -m pip install -r requirements-ci.txt
python swarmmojo.py harness --request examples/harness-request.json
python -B scripts/demo_harness.py
```

Replace `python` with that environment's executable; shell activation is optional. The [harness guide](docs/HARNESS.md) explains request fields, database setup and examples.

The harness demo uses a temporary synthetic knowledge index and selected skill to exercise real retrieval and the public CLI. It prints its checks and removes the fixture afterward.

Preparation retrieves keyword matches from an existing OKF index, reads explicitly selected Markdown skills, and evaluates supplied choices through the current Decision Maker. Retrieval uses the indexed snapshot; it does not revalidate the original documents. The response includes source hashes, a bounded context, a decision or abstention, and a proposed next step. It always reports `approval_required: true` and `execution_allowed: false`.

This path does not call a model, use the network, run tools, edit documents or save topic-discovery records. SQLite may use normal coordination sidecars. It is a preparation step for a caller or operator to review, not a complete autonomous execution loop.

## Other command-line tools

The existing utility CLI uses Python's standard library:

```sh
python swarmmojo.py --help
python swarmmojo.py index --path .
python swarmmojo.py lookup --query invoice_total_cents
python swarmmojo.py pack --costs "50,40,30" --values "100,60,50" --budget 70 --required 2
```

Commands for advisory decisions, memory, log compaction and snapshots are listed in `--help`. Utilities can write local state under `data/prefrontal/`; set `SWARMMOJO_DATA_DIR` when using the new launcher to choose another directory. Snapshot restoration writes files; review its limits before applying it to a real workspace.

Standalone Decision Maker utilities can also persist topic discovery. The new launcher defaults to `~/.swarmmojo`; set `SWARMMOJO_STATE_DIR` to choose another location. Harness preparation disables that persistence. Existing ROMS settings, command aliases and protocol IDs remain compatible; see the [migration guide](docs/MIGRATION.md).

## Connect an MCP client

The full server needs the packages in `requirements.txt` and an embedding model. Install them using the virtual environment's Python, then let your MCP client launch the server:

```sh
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python swarmmojo.py mcp
```

The command uses stdio and waits for MCP messages. For clients with an `mcpServers` configuration, use absolute paths:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "swarmmojo": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/SwarmMojo/.venv/bin/python",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/SwarmMojo/swarmmojo.py", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

On Windows, use `.venv/Scripts/python.exe`. Forward slashes work in JSON paths; otherwise escape each backslash. Configuration locations depend on the client.

Startup initializes the database, indexes supported files in `knowledge/`, loads local plugins and starts the watcher. The default embedding model is `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` on CPU; first use may download model files. Remote embedding providers send text to their configured endpoint. The index requires 384-dimensional embeddings; changing models requires a compatible rebuilt index. Review [security and data handling](SECURITY.md) before connecting an agent.

### Useful registered interfaces

| Task | Interface |
| --- | --- |
| Prepare a reviewable request | `swarmmojo_prepare_harness` with `request_json` |
| Search knowledge | `search_knowledge_base`, `search_grounded_context` |
| Add or refresh documents | `add_knowledge_document`, `reload_knowledge`, `list_knowledge_documents` |
| Retain and recall project lessons | `memory_retain`, `memory_recall`, `memory_get`, `memory_prepare_context` |
| Propose a regression check after a failure | `memory_propose_correction` or `python swarmmojo.py correction --help` |
| Record or revise lesson evidence | `memory_record_verification`, `memory_correct`, `memory_retract`, `memory_forget` |
| Get an advisory decision | `roms_decide`, `roms_noul`, `roms_score` |
| Find tools and skills | `search_tools`, `list_skills` |
| Read a skill | Resource `skills://{skill_name}` or prompt `get_skill_playbook` |
| Inspect logs and source locations | `roms_sieve_compact`, `roms_symdex_lookup` |

The server advertises the full tool list and schemas on connection. The harness tool uses the server's configured database and skills directory; it does not accept arbitrary paths. Other tools can write knowledge, change lessons, author skills or restore files. Caller-supplied verification records are not authenticated test results.

## Status and limits

SwarmMojo is a developer project for a trusted local operator. Its Python tools, native components and optional integrations have different prerequisites and verification scopes.

- Decision scores and retrieved text can be wrong. They do not establish truth or grant permission to change a system.
- Local plugins run with the server's permissions. Skills and retrieved documents are untrusted input to the agent.
- The optional model gateway needs a separately configured inference service. Installing SwarmMojo does not install model weights or an operating system.
- Dataset export does not train a model. Routing prototypes do not establish measured model-quality improvements.
- Benchmark reports cover specific fixtures and machines. No general latency, token-saving or GPU-performance guarantee is made. The planned 128 GB machine needs its own qualification.

## Verification

The no-install demo has standard-library regression checks:

```sh
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_first_run_demo.py -v
```

After installing `requirements-ci.txt` in your environment:

```sh
python -m pytest tests/test_first_run_demo.py tests/test_prefrontal_integration.py tests/test_decisions_jev_laya.py tests/test_release_safety.py tests/test_memory.py tests/test_context.py -q
```

The [harness guide](docs/HARNESS.md) records its checks, and the [CI workflow](.github/workflows/checks.yml) defines the portable test matrix. Native builds and live-model checks have separate prerequisites.

## Optional integrations and documentation

Three explicitly selected [specialist playbooks](docs/IMPORTED-SKILLS.md) are available for code review, architecture and technical writing. These concise local adaptations record their upstream source and retain its license. They are prompt text, not independently running agents or permissions.

The [upstream evaluation](docs/UPSTREAM-EVALUATION.md) distinguishes what is included from promising adapters, overlapping systems and unresolved project names.

For coding work, select a compact review playbook, use the existing workshop's configured PTRM reviewer to inspect code, and save recurring failures as [correction proposals](docs/local-memory.md#propose-a-regression-after-a-failure). PTRM reports distinguish full, partial and absent scan coverage; a clean or partial report cannot approve an edit. [Local harness and PTRM assessment](docs/research/local-coding-sources.md).

The model gateway tracks complete response termination so an interrupted stream cannot be recorded as a completed protocol exchange. Ordinary broker chat rejects truncated answers. These checks do not establish answer correctness or successful task execution.

The Linux/Omarchy workshop adds staged changes, registered validation and operator-approved promotion. It requires its own configured runtime and confinement components; those execution features are not established by the portable preparation command or a positive decision score.
