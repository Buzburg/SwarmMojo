"""AutoResearch: Autonomous Multi-Source Deep Investigation & Knowledge Compounding Engine.

Inspired by Karpathy's LLM OS and autonomous research methodologies:
- Topic Deconstruction: Breaks high-level research questions into targeted facet sub-queries
- Multi-Source Investigation: Coordinates ZG-Search (fuzzy), Topic-Routed RAG, and Dense RRF
- Cross-Verification & Fact Extraction: Extracts verifiable claims, metrics, and resolves contradictions
- Structured Research Dossier: Compiles comprehensive academic/engineering research reports
- Knowledge Compounding: Auto-publishes synthesized dossiers as Open Knowledge Format (OKF) documents into knowledge/,
  instantly indexing them into the cartridge so the system permanently learns from research findings.

## 1. Executive Summary
This research investigation synthesizes verified documentation, operational trajectories, and empirical knowledge surrounding **{clean_topic}**. The objective of this dossier is to provide a grounded, anti-hallucinatory reference for both autonomous agents and engineering teams.

## 2. Investigative Sub-Query Deconstruction
The research topic was systematically decomposed into the following investigative angles:
{subqueries_list}

## 3. Verified Evidence & Core Findings
Based on cross-referenced multi-source retrieval across the cartridge:
{facts_summary}

## 4. Source Evidence Ledger
The following knowledge assets were analyzed and ranked using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF):

| # | Document ID | RRF Score | Content Snapshot |
|---|-------------|-----------|------------------|
{sources_table}

## 5. Strategic Recommendations & Protocol
1. **Strict Parameter Adherence**: When operating under `{clean_topic}`, verify all operational constraints against verified documents prior to executing mutations.
2. **Defensive Validation**: Maintain explicit timeouts and automated fallback pathways for ambiguous edge cases.
3. **Continuous Trajectory Logging**: Capture execution steps to enable autonomous SOP evolution via the UpSkill engine.
